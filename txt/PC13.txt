W=BROK
C1A=MAYBE

T=If it wasn't for this picture I saved, I wouldn't even recall her face.

W=GRAFF
# original - When the national power shortout happened, all our files went... Gone!
# note: i would say power outage instead of power shortout, but i don't know if power shortout is used as an event name throughout the game.
