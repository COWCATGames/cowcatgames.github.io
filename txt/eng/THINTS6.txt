HINT_CH6_255_HACKERMONEY1=So... That hacker guy wants a ton of moolah. There aren't too many ways to get this within a day, kitty. Actually, there's only one. Think about what you picked up today...

HINT_CH6_290_ESCAPE1=There are several ways to get outta here, kitty. So... for once, I'll just be listing some elements to help.##- Your friend Ott is in the next room.##- You can almost move anywhere you want while tied up but the rats might spot you!##- The exit is a ladder at the far right of the corridor.##- There's a metal bar at the right wall of your room but to get it you'll need to break free.##- That little hook next to that cupboard could help to cut the rope but it'll take (a lot of) time.##Choose your own path!


#----- Hints BROK --------
HINT_CH6_255_BUNKERENTER1=Croc dude... If you choose to solve that puzzle, here's my advice for you : press everything! Ain't got time to think! But... I guess I'll give you the exact solution for the first part.##You need all lights to turn green. Each button activate some and deactivate others. Here are the buttons to press (from top left to bottom right) : 1, 3, 7, 8.
HINT_CH6_255_BUNKERENTER2=Here's a solution for the second part : 1, 9. (Is pressing two buttons too hard for you, croc?...)
HINT_CH6_255_BUNKERLASERS1=Just avoid those lasers, croc. If the kitty could do it, so can you!

HINT_CH6_260_BUNKERINTERROGATE1=Interrogate Dr. Gherkin.

HINT_CH6_270_GIVEBOX1=Give the little box you have to Dr. Gherkin.

HINT_CH6_280_SINJAIL1=You might be blocked by those lasers. Surely you've got something to deactivate them. Just use 'it' at the right time! And remember - those bots can only see what's in front of them.
HINT_CH6_280_SINJAIL2=Use your remote control to deactivate the lasers.

HINT_CH6_290_SEARCHGRAFF1=Search around the city for Graff. You know where he was the last time, right?... You might want to prepare yourself before going there, though.

HINT_CH6_320_KEYWORDS1=Croc dude, you gotta assemble a sentence of three words! Like "CHICKEN LOVES FAT" (no, don't try that one).##It's linked to what you've just deduced. And for each word, there's an icon - look at them!
