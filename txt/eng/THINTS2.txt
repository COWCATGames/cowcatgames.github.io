#----- Hints GRAFF --------
HINT_CH2_80_TRIAL1=Kitty, if you expect me to give you the replies... You're mistaken! Pretty sure you'll get the correct answers at the end of the day, anyway. But if you're adventurous, why not take a look-see at Ott for some replies?##Actually you don't even have to answer anything! Just click on the upper right button on your tablet to send and you're good to go!

# If we choose to protect our own machine
HINT_CH2_100_GETSCREWDRIVER1=You'll need that screwdriver in Shay's garage. Borrow it! (it's among the tools on that floating chair)
HINT_CH2_100_OPENPANEL1=Kitty, you need something to electrocute anyone who would dare touch your invention. Go to Sector 56X!
HINT_CH2_100_OPENPANEL2=That button which serves as infophone (at the right of the gate) should do the job! But in order to take it, you'll need to deactivate it first...
HINT_CH2_100_OPENPANEL3=Use a screwdriver to open the panel on the left side of the gate.
HINT_CH2_100_CUTWIRES1=Kitty, you need to deactivate two wires from the panel. There's a paw print icon at the bottom with two wires going out of it.##Follow them (with your eyes!), they're all uniquely designed. Then turn the thumb wheels at the top corresponding to them.
HINT_CH2_100_CUTWIRES2=Press the following thumb wheels (from left to right) : 5 and 7.

# If we choose to mess with their machines
