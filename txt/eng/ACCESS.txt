another room directly beside the one Graff was held in, with approximately the same size.

AUDIOD_PC01=Brok awakens in his apartment which is pretty small. At the bottom left corner is Brok’s mattress. There’s a table at the center of the room, with a fridge and front door in the back.

AUDIOD_PC02=Brok enters a hallway with a corridor that juts to the upper part of the screen towards two doors. In the middle of the room is a glass bulletin board. The exit is a staircase that doesn’t completely cover the right part of the room.
AUDIOD_PC02_LASERS=Brok encounters lasers blocking the way out.
AUDIOD_PC03=Brok exits the building from the left. The air is polluted and the ground littered with trash. In the background we can see a landfill. To the right is a pipe and a small area where a Tramp lingers in. There’s a small elevator northeast of the entrance to go on the roof of the building. The rooftop, while bigger, has less stuff around it. It wraps around the lower area, with an entrance to the Trasher hunt in the northwest part of the building rooftop.
AUDIOD_PC04=Brok enters a long stretch of road. This is a clear contrast with the Slums, with brightly colored stores in a futuristic fashion.

To the right of the pharmacy is a giant fountain.
AUDIOD_PC04_ITEMINSIDE=Brok puts the item inside.
AUDIOD_PC04B=Brok enters a long hallway with a manhole near the other side, a small gutter on the left, and some debris in the back. 5 big crates are preventing from progressing further.
AUDIOD_PC04C=Brok enters an oval shaped room with a small corridor making him go upwards to enter the rest of it at the start. There’s a display of products at the center of the room with a few more along the walls as well. On the right are screens which are inviting the user to interact with.
AUDIOD_PC05=Brok climbs down from the ladder into a long, curved corridor consisting of a small gap for water and two platforms spanning the length of either side of the alley connected by a single, small stone bridge. On the right platform there is also a pool of acid that spans the length of the platform as well.
AUDIOD_PC05B=Brok enters a very long hallway from the left, continuing from the previous room. The upper platform is where Brok stands. The river part underneath has no water, but it does have some acid in the bottommost right part of it just before a connecting bridge.

AUDIOD_PC05B_RATS=Brok sees a group of three tough rats. Behind them is a basket with a pipe coming out from the ceiling.
AUDIOD_PC05C=Brok enters a very small rectangular room. There’s a slightly higher platform that he starts on and a slightly lower platform. Machinery is displayed on the right, preventing from continuing further. It appears the machine is filtering the water, with a big pool stored in the lower right corner.
AUDIOD_PC06=Brok enters a very long stretch of road. Not too far from the entrance walking to the right is a merchant stall. There is an arching bridge with some platforms Brok can climb up to reach the roof of it. To the far right there is a building with a metal gate blocking the entrance.

AUDIOD_PC07B=Brok enters the small room from the north. His client Sin is waiting a bit below. At the bottom left corner there’s a combination wardrobe and fridge and right beside it is a table. To the right of the door is a small drawer. This apartment has a second room, which is located to the right. Sin is standing next to the entrance. In that very small room there is a shower at the bottom right corner as well as a mirror to the north of it.
AUDIOD_PC07B_WESAPPEARS=Suddenly, the wall explodes. The police chief Wes appears, accompanied by a Tribot. Wes is a slender looking otter. He's kinda old with very bushy eyebrows covering his eyes.
AUDIOD_PC08=Brok enters the area from the right side. Northwards leads to a lake with two islands, the closer one smaller while the further one goes all the way to the right. A boat is floating in the lake upside down on the right side. On the left there’s a small hexagonal fence that leads to the garage itself.
AUDIOD_PC08_OUTOFLOOP=The garage disappeared, and Brok no longer has a detective hat.
AUDIOD_PC08B=Brok enters from the northern entrance to a slightly big room. There’s a large desk by the southwest corner as well as shelves all along the left wall. There’s an entrance to another room on the right wall. Shay is working at her desk on the bottom left corner of the room.

AUDIOD_PC08C_HUG=Brok hugs Shay while the garage disappears.
AUDIOD_PC09=Brok enters a rectangular shaped room from the right. There are slightly raised bars by the entrance on the left, to give an impression of a hallway that one
would have to walk around or jump over. At the northern part of the room is a door that leads to the chief office. Three bots are guarding the place. One is located beneath a long counter along the rightmost wall. Another one is in the bottom left corner, while the last one is watching from the top left corner.
AUDIOD_PC09B=Brok enters the jail, which is composed of three cells on the left half of the room. Brok is led to his small cell, which is the bottom most one. The other half of the room is a semi-circle shape, with the exit to the right.
AUDIOD_PC09C=Brok enters the small circular room from the northwestern door. This is the chief office. We can see a black board filled with cases, clues and suspect information written in background. Along the upper part of the room is a large desk. Graff's friend Ott is using this desk, working at a computer. On the lower right part of the room is an even bigger desk. A couple of chairs are scattered around the room as well.
AUDIOD_PC09C_WESPICTURE=This is a picture of Wes in three-quarters angle.
AUDIOD_PC09D=Brok is led to the small hallway in the upper part of the room before being escorted to the square shaped room itself, with a giant triangular table at the center of it.
AUDIOD_PC10=Graff is sitting at his desk beside other students: Ott, Klay and Stubot. The consciousness center is fully covered by a large, transparent glass, through which we can see all the Slums in background. Their desks are set up directly beside each other making a small table in the middle of the rectangular shaped building. At the northeast part of the building is a big door that leads into the outer area, which is also rectangular shaped. The exit of this room is located at the center in the far background of the area.
AUDIOD_PC11=Brok wakes up in a small apartment room in fire. There’s two doors, one on the right side of the room and one on the left. There’s flaming debris blocking the door on the right as well as some debris around.
AUDIOD_PC11_FRAME=Brok sees a picture frame composed exclusively of a triangle pattern.
AUDIOD_PC11B=Brok enters a slightly longer room which seems like a living room.  There are four doors, two on the left side and two on the right side. A device stands at the center of the room and three robots are scattered. There’s flames all along the bottom of the room.
AUDIOD_PC11C=Brok enters a longer room. In the first half there’s the door Brok came in from, a giant rock on the upper part of his path and a hole in the lower half with a toppled shelf making a bridge across it. The second half of the room is more open, with a bed at the top part and a shelf beside it. Below them is a toppled part of the building with someone caught under it.
AUDIOD_PC11C_GUILTY=On the wall is briefly written "Guilty".
AUDIOD_PC11D=Brok finds himself in a strange dark place looking like an old hospital. He arrives from the left, and this is a very, very long hallway.

AUDIOD_PC11D_WRONGSHOW=Brok sees three bodies of his friends, who replace the bots he killed earlier.
AUDIOD_PC12=Brok enters a big area from the south-left entrance. Two buildings are visible, the left one is the postal service with an antenna on top and the right one is the security building with a roof shaped like a pyramid. Along the bottom of the area are two statues, with some benches directly above them. To the right is the dome itself, seemingly made of glass. The entrance is guarded by a scanner and a security camera.
AUDIOD_PC12_DRUMER=Graff, Clay, Ott, and the Director are in front of the border post.
AUDIOD_PC12_DRUMERLEAVE=Graff is walking away while looking at Brok with tears in his eyes, smiling.
AUDIOD_PC12_PROTEST=Brok sees a few citizens with protest signs in front of the border.
AUDIOD_PC12B=Brok enters from the top-left of the building. There are several platforms and laser traps further down the building. At the far bottom is a computer located on the right side and a strange large device with the number 15 on the left. The exit is in the southern part of the bottom room.
AUDIOD_PC12B_KNOBS=Turn the knobs until the power gets to 0.
AUDIOD_PC12B_MAINFRAME=A rotating shape appears on-screen, made of four triangles.
AUDIOD_PC13_CAMERA=The camera moves to reveal a beautiful landscape beyond the trash, with a dome afar and a polluted sky that always looks like sunset.
AUDIOD_PC13_FALL=Brok jumps to his death. This is the very same view of the Slums that he and Graff were looking at earlier.
AUDIOD_PC13_SELFIE=Brok takes a selfie where he appears funny, with Graff clearly unprepared in the background.
AUDIOD_PC14=Brok enters a dark street from the east side. It feels like people are living here but no one can be seen. There’s a giant square shaped hole about halfway
down the street on the southern side. North of that hole is one platform that can be created, and just to the right of that is another platform slightly above it with some clothes hanging, and yet another platform to the right and slightly above that.
AUDIOD_PC14_CORNERED=Ott and Graff get cornered by several rats.
AUDIOD_PC14_GRAFFARRIVES=Graff arrives on the scene and sees Brok kicking the rats' butts.
AUDIOD_PC14_RAT=Brok sees a rat on the phone in front of a hole in the ground.
AUDIOD_PC14B=Brok walks into a street corner and is right beside a building. There’s a crossing at the street but the northern part doesn’t go very far. A  big bear with a policeman outfit is guarding a door.
AUDIOD_PC14C=Brok enters the small room from the northeast entrance. It looks like an abandoned restaurant. There’s a large counter sprawling at the top left part of the room and a table at the center of the same room, which serves as the desk for a hacker mouse. Some pizzant leftovers are on the ground while there's a mess of equipment in background.
AUDIOD_PC15=Brok and Ott exit a hovercar to stand in front of a long series of connected buildings. Directly to the south of them is the highway for the hovercars that they zoom by on periodically.
AUDIOD_PC15_BIKE=Brok climbs on the bike while Tidy is running away on the highway.
AUDIOD_PC15B=Brok and Ott enter a small oval shaped room. A delivery tube is to the right while the Guard’s desk is to the left. There are three doors on the north part of the room.
AUDIOD_PC15C=Brok and Ott enter a small square shaped room. There is a small floating desk on the lower left part of the room, a long table at the center, a bed directly north of that and another desk to the right of the bed.

Family is crucial, thus you must be capable of understanding this logic quickly. Question 4: nothing. Try replacing. Question 5: PU, IN, or MA; they are the rainbow colors. RE equals red, OR equals orange. The last one should be purple; indigo and magenta also accepted. Question 6: There is no good answer, but you must absolutely choose between the two options. Please note that if your friend was specified as Drumer and the ten strangers as Slumers, the correct answer would've been to save your friend.
