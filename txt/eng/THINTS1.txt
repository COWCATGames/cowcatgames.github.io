# Note that the narrator of the hints uses a very informal language. He's talking like he's Brok's (and Graff's) best friend.
# There won't be a voice actor for those (only text)

#----- Hints --------
HINT_CH1_10_HOOVER1=Hey croc dude, if you wanna meet that client, try getting out of the apartment first! Maybe something around here could help you get rid of the hoover without touching it directly?
HINT_CH1_10_HOOVER2=Take the stick and attack the hoover with it. Of course, you'll need to switch to action mode first!
HINT_CH1_10_ENTERSECTOR56X1=To enter Sin's Center Basic 568 front door, you need to enter a code. I know your brain is full of holes but Sin gave it to you!
HINT_CH1_10_ENTERSECTOR56X2=Sin sent you the code in a phone message - 4098. The device to type the code only has three buttons.##I doubt you're clever enough to figure out how to type it, so if you can't afford using another ad, just smash buttons randomly like you usually do.
HINT_CH1_10_ENTERSECTOR56X3=Left button is two and multiplies the digit by two, right button is three and multiplies by three. Middle button changes the digit.##To enter 4098, press the buttons in this order : left, left, middle, middle, right, right, middle, left, left, left.
HINT_CH1_10_MEETSIN1=What are you waiting for, croc dude? Enter Center Basic 568 and talk to Sin! His apartment is the first door on the right.
HINT_CH1_20_MORETALK1=You'd better ask Sin for more info about the gun and Drumer Street before leaving!
HINT_CH1_20_DRUMERBEFORESHAY1=You can't access Drumer Street without authorization. Maybe your friend Shay has a trick up her sleeve!
HINT_CH1_20_ENTERSHAY1=Looks like Shay is at it again... To open the garage, you need to press both buttons quickly while avoiding the saw-of-the-ultimate-death!
HINT_CH1_20_ENTERSHAY2=Best way to do this is to press the right button, then the left one.
HINT_CH1_20_TALKSHAY1=Talk to Shay! She must know a way to cross the border.
HINT_CH1_20_PYRAMIDBEFORE1=Your ultimate goal is to reach the top of the pyramid! Wow, that's high!##How to achieve that, you say?... Have you tried talking with that sobby robot?
HINT_CH1_20_PYRAMIDBEFORE2=This depressing bot used to work for the sorting center. Access it, and you might find a way to get on top. Just ask him to open it!
HINT_CH1_20_PYRAMIDCURRENT1=Enter the sorting center and... well, try the buttons on that commands panel. Oh, you can move packages! Can I suggest messing with it?
HINT_CH1_20_PYRAMIDCURRENT2=Hey! Have you noticed that you can reach the top of the sorting center with the elevator inside?
HINT_CH1_20_PYRAMIDCURRENT3=Use the command panel at the bottom of the building. Try sending a tall package into the right (triangular) pipe. It'll get stuck! Do that again with a square package. Then jump on them to reach the center platform above!
HINT_CH1_20_PYRAMIDTOP1=Almost there! Don't even think about it croc dude, you'll never make that jump to the pyramid.##If only you could lower that filthy plank to get across...
HINT_CH1_20_PYRAMIDTOP2=You've got exactly what you need in your inventory to release that plank, croc dude. Believe me. You do!
HINT_CH1_20_PYRAMIDTOP3=Your apartment key doubles as a screwdriver. Use it on the right side plank, punch it and get across the pyramid!
HINT_CH1_20_PYRAMIDENTER1=Enter the pyramid
HINT_CH1_20_PYRAMIDINSIDETOP1=Avoid the lasers, croc dude! Take your time to study the situation. It may even be possible to deactivate those lasers if you look carefully...
HINT_CH1_20_PYRAMIDINSIDETOP2=Those arrow buttons on the floor indicate which direction lasers will go when you press 'em.##As for the numbers on the floor? That's how many buttons you need to activate. Good luck!
HINT_CH1_20_PYRAMIDINSIDEPANEL1=Stick your... stick (or your apartment key) on that panel to open it!
HINT_CH1_20_PYRAMIDINSIDEINSIDE1=Your goal is to get the power out to deactivate the room lasers. Rotate the buttons until the electricity beam crosses all the "minus" buttons and none of the "plus" buttons!
HINT_CH1_20_PYRAMIDINSIDEINSIDE2=Here's a solution :

HINT_CH1_20_PYRAMIDINSIDEBOTTOM1=That triangle button isn't just for starting the mainframe. You need to collect four pieces which can be put together to form a triangle.
HINT_CH1_20_PYRAMIDINSIDEBOTTOM2=From left to right, click on the pieces number : 2, 4, 8, 13
HINT_CH1_20_PYRAMIDOK1=Hold your breath and try the scanner at the border post...
HINT_CH1_20_BORDER1=Enter Drumer street.
HINT_CH1_30_ELECTRICBARRIER1=The back alley, croc dude! If only it wasn't for that energy barrier... Surely someone has the key to disable it!
HINT_CH1_30_ELECTRICBARRIER2=Mister Tribot cop is seemingly guarding the Pipe-Mail. What a waste of time if you ask me.##Anyway, his battery is almost dead! What do you think about bringing him further from the power source?
HINT_CH1_30_ELECTRICBARRIER3=I hate Tribots. Yeah, even if I'm an AI myself. Does this count as racism?##Anyway. Mess with the Pipe-Mail! Try getting something stuck in there! See that fountain? Maybe that could be useful too!
HINT_CH1_30_ELECTRICBARRIER4=Use the Pred toy on the fountain water, then stuff it into the Pipe-Mail. Wait a few seconds, and ta-da!##In case you didn't pick it up yet (open your eyes, croc dude!), it's located at the top of the building near your home, near the Trasher Hunt.
HINT_CH1_30_POWERSOCKET1=Distracting the Tribot cop is the way to go! But you'd better do something to that power socket so he can't recharge anymore!
HINT_CH1_30_POWERSOCKET2=Use your apartment key in the power socket to break it, then wait for the cop to come back!
HINT_CH1_30_TRIBOTKEY1=Take the key that the Tribot cop left and use it near the energy barrier!
HINT_CH1_30_ALLEY1=Enter the back alley
HINT_CH1_40_SEWERSGRATE1=Don't tell me you didn't break those crates? Use your fists, croc dude!##When you're done, check out the sewers grate! Maybe you could spot what you're looking for?
HINT_CH1_40_SEWERSGRATE2=You obviously can't see the bottom of the sewers very well from there. But I'm pretty sure you can improve that situation with some "magical" item!
HINT_CH1_40_SEWERSGRATE3=Come on! Use that magnify glass to zoom in! (You picked it up at home, right?) There's a clue shaped like a... handkerchief.
HINT_CH1_40_SEWERSMANHOLE1=Go down the sewers! Okay, so the manhole is firmly shut. No problem!##See those panels? They're buttons. Push them in a the right order. Which one? Observe carefully!
HINT_CH1_40_SEWERSMANHOLE2=There are lines scratches over some buttons, as if someone tried to inscribe the order directly on the manhole (kinda like writing your computer password on a sticky note and attaching it to your computer - don't laugh, you've done it too!)##So, press the button at the top which has exactly one line. Then the bottom right one in the inner circle with two lines. Etc...
HINT_CH1_40_SEWERSBEFORE1=Examine the marks where some water remains. Then pick up the handkerchief and progress through the sewers.
HINT_CH1_50_BEFORERAT1=Having trouble with those mines, croc dude? Just walk slowly. Those mines are invisible devices programmed to appear when you get close enough.##Oh and... There's a way to get rid of them! Wanna know? That will cost you another ad!
HINT_CH1_50_BEFORERAT2=Pick up the remote control in Sin's apartment (it's located at the top right of the bed after you make it fall) Then bring it to Shay to repair it.##Use that remote control on the mines to deactivate them temporarily!
HINT_CH1_50_RATSPIPE1=Really? You won't fight them?! Wow, I'm learning a new side of you everyday!##Of course, you'll need to progress anyway, so you'll have to find another way to get rid of those rats. Hey, isn't that a pipe behind the Squealers?... Maybe it's connected to that Pipe-Mail from the street above?
HINT_CH1_50_RATSPIPE2=Did you pick up the broken mine near those rats? Putting it inside the Pipe-Mail on Drumer street could have some... interesting effects!##But alas, it's broken... Maybe try asking for a friend's opinion?
HINT_CH1_50_RATSPIPE3=Shay is always the best person to ask for just about everything. Remember that small robot in the corridor outside of your apartment?##You'll need to mix the mine with the powder leaking out from it! Then put the mine into the Pipe-Mail and ask it to recycle.
HINT_CH1_50_GUNBEFORE1=Hey croc dude, I bet the gun you're looking for is stuck inside that circuitry! You can surely get it out by using that snake. Just try pushing it as much as possible to the exit. Make several attempts if you need to!
HINT_CH1_50_GUNBEFORE2=Solution :
HINT_CH1_50_GUNAFTER1=Inspect that gun!
HINT_CH1_60_PICTURE1=Before you give the gun back, check Sin's mirror. You missed a picture on the side, croc dude!
HINT_CH1_60_BACKTOSIN1=You got the gun. Go back and talk to your client, croc dude!
#HINT_CH1_60_SINMISSINGCLUE1=Looking for the truth? You better have solid proof! If you're missing some clue, press their icon during the interrogation to give you an indication where to search.
HINT_CH1_60_SININTERROGATION1=Ya got all the clues ya need, croc dude! Interrogate Sin!

HINT_CH1_60_CLUE_SIN_REMOTECONTROL_NO1=You missed something around Sin's bed, croc dude! First, bring it down!
HINT_CH1_60_CLUE_SIN_REMOTECONTROL_NO2=Take the remote control hanging in the upper-right corner of Sin's bed.

HINT_CH1_60_CLUE_SIN_REMOTECONTROL_YES1=Show that damaged remote control to Shay! (you know, that crazy inventor)

HINT_CH1_60_CLUE_DRUMERSTREET_CAMERAOFF1=Inside the pharmacy, there's an odd camera-bubble thingy in the back. Check it out!

HINT_CH1_60_CLUE_DRUMERSTREET_PILL_NO1=Don't hesitate to enter other guys' bathroom! You missed something at Sin's, croc dude.
HINT_CH1_60_CLUE_DRUMERSTREET_PILL_NO2=Take that pill next to the cup.
HINT_CH1_60_CLUE_DRUMERSTREET_PILL_YES1=The pharmacy offers a scanner to detect products. This might come in handy!
HINT_CH1_60_CLUE_DRUMERSTREET_PILL_YES2=Show Sin's pill on the pharmacy scanner to find out what it is!

HINT_CH1_60_CLUE_SECTOR56X_SLEEPING1=You should talk to that merchant in Sector 56X! She might know something!
HINT_CH1_60_CLUE_DRUMERSTREET_DRAWERFORCED1=Hey! Have you checked that left drawer in the back of the pharmacy?
HINT_CH1_70_FIGHTSIN1=Time to fight Sin, croc dude! Avoid his glasses or block them with your guard button. Make sure you stock enough food!


HINT_CH1_20_PYRAMIDCURRENTBLIND1=Enter the sorting center to automatically climb to the top.
HINT_CH1_20_PYRAMIDMAINFRAMEBLIND1=Press all the buttons with triangular shape.
