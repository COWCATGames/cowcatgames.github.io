T=Only one of us could have done it.
W=MINK

T=Yes.
W=OTT

T=The body was first seen when we entered this room.
W=OTT
C3A=ALRIGHT

T=It appears Dr. Hush has been struck on the head and died due to the impact.
W=OTT

T=Considering there's blood on the lamp located right next to him, this must be the murder weapon.
W=OTT

T=This lamp belongs to Doctor Mink. This implies the murderer had access to it.
W=OTT

T=I don't like where this is heading...
W=MINK
C2A=MEH

T=Dr. Hush was last seen alive by his assistant bot Tidy at 5:04.
W=OTT

T=The possibilities are limited.
W=OTT

T=Again, he could not leave the building. The only exit has an impassable power barrier.
W=OTT
C3A=ALRIGHT

T=He couldn't have exited his room and stayed in the hall. It wouldn't make sense, and Mister Guard would have noticed it.

W=GUARD

T=Let's continue.
W=OTT
C3A=ALRIGHT

T=Dr. Hush could have gone to the restroom and been killed there.
W=OTT

T=But that leaves one problem...
W=OTT

T=We didn't find his body there but in Dr. Mink's room.
W=OTT

T=This means he would have to be carried to the next room, without anyone noticing.
W=OTT

T=If he somehow got carried out of the restroom, Mister Guard would have noticed it.
W=OTT

T=We've checked the restroom. There's no access between it and Dr. Mink's room.
W=BROK

T=So that leaves only one option. Dr. Hush went straight from his office to Dr. Mink's.
W=OTT

T=Nonsense! He never came here!

T=However, he could not access Dr. Mink's room.
